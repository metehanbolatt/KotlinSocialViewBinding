## Basic Instagram Clone
  
In this project, I used viewBinding and Google Firebase.

## User Login and User Registration

For user registration, name, surname, e-mail and password information are requested from the user.  

For user login, only e-mail and password are required.

## User Profile View  
  
The project is still under development. That reason, there is only a button to log out in this section.

  # Thanks
This project was developed by me to reinforce what I learned after the ["Android Mobil Uygulama Kursu Kotlin & Java"](https://www.udemy.com/course/android-o-mobil-uygulama-dersi-kotlin-java/) course.  
I would like to thank our esteemed teacher Atıl Samancıoğlu for preparing this course.
